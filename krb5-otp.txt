Internet-Draft            Combined Password+OTP                June 2014


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   There exist pre-authentication methods for Kerberos [RFC4120] for
   using passwords (PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP [RFC4120]) or OTP [RFC6560].
   However, it is currently not possible to combine these for use at the
   same time for a variety of reasons, including insufficiencies in the
   generalized pre-authentication framework (GPAF) [RFC6113] and an
   inability to select from amongst multiple passwords for the same
   principal:

   o  GPAF does not provide a way for the KDC to indicate the
      combination subsets of pre-authentication methods that may be
      used, nor even the order in which they must be attempted;

   o  GPAF does not provide a way for multiple pre-authentication
      methods to be used in an optimal manner (optimal as to network
      round trips);

   o  No implementations exist demonstrating that GPAF's pre-
      authentication method combination facility works;

   o  A GPAF password and OTP combination (with existing pre-
      authentication methods) does not protect the OTP payloads with
      both the FAST tunnel's protection and a key derived from the
      password-based pre-authentication method;

   o  The existing password-based pre-authentication method's notion of
      opaque string2key function parameters has not worked out well.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

2.  Design of the new combined password and OTP pre-authentication

   This new pre-authentication method, henceforth PA-PW-OTP, is a simple
   iteration on the existing PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP pre-authentication method,
   but carrying PA-OTP-* pre-authentication messages [RFC6560] in an
   EncryptedData payload.  That is, the PA-OTP-* messages are double-
   tunneled, with a FAST outer tunnel and a password-based inner tunnel.
   The new method's reply key is the result of a combination of the OTP
   method's reply key and the password-derived key and challenge.

   This FAST factor provides the following facilities (as defined in
   [RFC6113]): client-authentication, replacing-reply-key, and
   authentication of the KDC to the client.  It does not provide the
   strengthening-reply-key facility.

2.1.  Messages

   We define four pre-authentication messages (see Appendix A):

   PA-PWOTP-REQUEST-PARAMS  Request string2key parameters.

   PA-PWOTP-RESPONSE-PARAMS  Response to PA-PWOTP-REQUEST-PARAMS.

   PA-PWOTP-REQUEST  Request containing an EncryptedData tunneling the
      OTP PA-DATA.

   PA-PWOTP-RESPONSE  Response containing an EncryptedData tunneling the
      OTP PA-DATA and/or error information.

   If state needs to be kept by the double-tunneled pre-authentication
   method, then it should use PA-FX-COOKIE, per the GPAF [RFC6113].

2.2.  Protocol exchanges

   First, note that realms MAY (and probably will) maintain a separate
   password for use with this method than for use with the traditional
   PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP method (where it remains available).

   [[anchor1: We may need to revise RFC3244 to permit changing of this
   password in that case! -Nico]]

   An AS client first decides to use this pre-authentication methods.
   This choice might be a result of local configuration), or the client
   might learn from attempting an AS exchange which the AS then rejects
   with PA data indicating that this method is available.

   An AS indicates availability of this pre-authentication method by
   including a PA-DATA of type PA-PWOTP-RESPONSE-PARAMS.

   An AS client wishing to use this pre-authentication method but
   lacking knowledge of available string-to-key parameters MUST send an
   AS-REQ with PA-PWOTP-REQUEST-PARAMS; the AS will respond with PA-
   PWOTP-RESPONSE-PARAMS, if this method is available.

   Note that a PA-PWOTP-RESPONSE-PARAMS PADATA MAY include a challenge,
   which the client then MUST include in the subsequent request.

   Once a client has the string-to-key parameters, the client computes a
   key derived from the principal's password as follows:

             if (s2kparams.salt)
                salt = s2kparams.salt
             else
                salt = ""
             if (s2kparams.salt_cname)
                salt = salt || "/" || cname
             if (s2kparams.salt_crealm)
                salt = salt || "@" || crealm
             precursor_key = string2key(s2kparams, pw, salt)
             pwotp-pwkey = pseudo-random(precursor_key, cnonce)

   The client then produces the RFC6560 OTP PADATA, wraps it in a PWOTP-
   REQ-PAYLOAD, encrypts that in a key derived from the pwotp-pwkey with
   key usage [TBD], and produces the PA-PWOTP-REQUEST for use in the AS-
   REQ.  The client sends the AS-REQ.

   The AS processes the request, notes the use of this method, and if it
   is acceptable, computes the pwotp-pwkey as described above and
   attempts to decrypt the payload.  If the decryption fails, the AS
   responds with a KRB-ERROR PDU, otherwise it validates the challenge
   (if present, or rejects if absent but should have been present) and
   the timestamps (also if present, which then must be within the skew
   window).  Either a challenge, timestamps, or both, must be present.

   The AS responds with a KRB-ERROR and PADATA for this pre-
   authentication method when the method can be continued.

   On success the AS responds with an AS-REP with a Ticket and an
   optional PADATA for this method.

2.3.  Reply key computation

   The reply key is produce by applying the GPAF KRB-FX-CF2() to the
   reply key output by the tunneled pre-authentication method, and the
   key derived from the principal's password, as follows:

      padata_number = <number of _this_ pre-authentication method
                       as used in the bearing PDU>
      pwkey = <see above>
      pwpepper = "pwotp-pwkey" || tostring(padata_number)
      inner_reply_key = <from inner pre-authentication method>
      inner_pepper = "pwotp-inner" || tostring(padata_number)
      key = KRB-FX-CF2(pwkey, pwpepper, inner_reply_key, inner_pepper)

3.  New string2key functionality

   This preauthentication method supports more than one string-to-key
   function per-enctype, and even goes so far as to permit separation of
   string-to-key functions from enctypes.  It does this by using a
   number to identify a string-to-key function in the method's messages.

   Additionally, in order to correct a flaw in the Kerberos cryptosystem
   [RFC3961], we no longer treat string-to-key parameters as opaque.
   Making string-to-key function parameters opaque complicated the
   administration of those parameters: indeed, no protocol has been
   deployed by which the opaque string-to-key parameters could be set,
   thus leaving them effectively run-time constants.  The likely cause
   of this failure is the string-to-key parameters' opacity: each
   enctype would have to define a sub-protocol for administration!
   Instead we provide for up to four non-opaque parameters: three
   numbers and a salt.  The three numeric string-to-key parameters are
   expected to have function-specific meanings and valid ranges, but
   otherwise they should be sufficient for expressing at least three
   dimensions of computational expense (e.g., memory and time
   complexity).

   Initially only one string-to-key function is defined, with number 0:
   the one defined by the enctype indicated in the message.  In the
   future we may define additional string-to-key functions that will not
   be associated with any one enctype; those functions will output an
   octet string from which a protocol key will be derived by use of an
   enctype's random-to-key() function.

   The choice of string-to-key parameter set is left to the client,
   which must choose from those offerings that the client supports.

4.  Security Considerations

   Knowledge of an OTP by an attacker does not allow the attacker to
   compromise the protocol.  Knowledge of the password does not permit
   an attacker to compromise the protocol either: because we use a FAST
   tunnel.  It is important that clients use strong FAST armor tickets.

   The authentication service (AS) of the KDC gets to see the OTP
   payloads.
